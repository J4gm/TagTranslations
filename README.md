# TAG TRANSLATIONS

![Comparison](https://i.postimg.cc/44M5dBWF/comparison.png)

Recently, Fabric and NeoForge began supporting localisation for Minecraft's tag system, including adding translations for the convention tag namespace (the "c" namespace). These translations are used by Just Enough Items for its block and item tag entries. However, Fabric and NeoForge do not currently provide translations for the vanilla ("minecraft") namespace. This is the gap filled by Tag Translations.

As well as JEI, this mod works with any other mod that makes use of translated tags, such as [Tag Tooltips](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tagtooltips).

Currently, only English translations are provided. If you'd like to contribute another language, get in touch or [submit a pull request on the Github](https://github.com/J4gm/TagTranslations).
